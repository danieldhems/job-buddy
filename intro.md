#The need
If you're a software developer or someone who is in high-demand for your skills, the job hunt can be very hectic when you have tens of calls and emails per day from eager agents about 'market leading' roles.

Keeping track of every call and job spec, not to mention your own thoughts and feelings on which roles are worth investigating, and which interviews to go for.

This is why a dashboard would be useful in both allowing you to keep track of the influx of roles and agents, and providing every iota of information you have, at a glance, so that you can make an informed decision, quickly.

It has happened to me on more than one occasion that I've either mistakenly passed up a great opportunity, or wasted time on a not-so-great one.

#The possibilities
Beyond just serving as a quick-access dashboard, I have plans to develop this app toward a complete job hunt management tool. Some features include:

## Email and Social media integration
 Integrate with Gmail and social media in order to provide features such as automatic creation of records in the app via smart-searching inboxes and feeds and scraping the relevant details from anything that could be a role.
 This could be handy when you either don't want to manually copy emails or messages from multiple channels in to the app yourself.
 It could also be super-helpful in making sure important info doesn't get lost in the shuffle or in your trash inbox (some very important emails for me have always ended up in the trash despite my best efforts, meaning I have to fish them out)

## Interview planning
With all the data you record for interviews, the app will allow you to effectively plan travel to client sites and even plan multiple interviews on the same day i.e. quickest routes via google directions and even local travel service updates that might effect jour journey

These are just a few ideas I have for where I want to take this project, and I hope you can see the benefit for such a tool, especially if you've ever been swamped by calls from eager recruiters.
